- title: "Asymmetric Learning for Spectral Graph Neural Networks"
  image: AAAI2025-AL.png
  description: Optimizing spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) remains a critical challenge in the field due to poorly understood dynamics. To address this, we analyze differences between graph convolution and feature transformation parameters, revealing their role in creating poorly conditioned problems. We then introduce the block condition number of the Hessian matrix and propose an asymmetric learning approach that dynamically preconditions gradients to improve optimization.

  description: Current methods for computing shortest-path distances in dynamic road networks face limitations with slow queries or inefficient maintenance, especially at scale. We introduce Dual-Hierarchy Labelling (DHL), a state-of-the-art approach that achieves significantly faster construction and updates, processes queries 2–4 times quicker, and uses only 10–20% of the labeling space.

To tackle this, we propose DeepSN, a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture based on sheaf theory, which models influence propagation as a sheaf diffusion-reaction process, capturing the complex dynamics of real-world information diffusion.

  description: Labelling-based solutions are the current state-of-the-arts to render fast response time to distance queries on road networks. However, they still result in large search spaces on distance labels when road networks are large. We propose a novel solution based on a simple but efficient data structure, called balanced tree hierarchy, which can perform 1.5-4 times faster in query processing and achieve up to 60% smaller labelling size compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

Then we explore the power of contrastive loss to incorporate an one-to-one mapping constraint into the learning objective through the choice of negative samples that are most informative. This leads to StableGM, a new deep graph matching architecture based on stable marriage algorithms, with theoretical guarantees of the dual-optimality of matching solutions.

  description: Graph search, a fundamental element of graph theory, plays an important role in solving many problems that cannot be tackled by GNNs. In this work, we investigate the expressivity of graph neural network (GNN) from the perspective of graph search. Two classical graph search methods, breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), are studied in the context of GNNs. We show either method can be used to design a vertex colouring algorithm, called local vertex colouring (LVC), which goes beyond 1-WL.

In the search for an answer to this question, we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the WL hierarchy is not well-suited for measuring expressive GNNs. Thus, we explore a hierarchy of expressivity that is grounded on a new class of graph isomorphism algorithms, namely Neighbourhood WL algorithms, which exhibit a natural and strict hierarchy of expressivity for measuring GNNs.

As of yet, batch-dynamic algorithms for shortest-path distance have been left unexplored, depsite that distance querying is a fundmental problem in many real-world applications.

- title: "FACH: Fast Algorithm for Detecting Cohesive Hierarchies of Communities in Large Networks"
  image: WSDM2018-FACH.png
  description: We study the hierarchical community detection problem in large networks and show that this problem is NP-hard. We leverage a fast network sparsification technique to improve the efficiency and scalability of a cut-based algorithm for detecting a cohesive hierarchy of communities in a large-scale network.
