- title: "BatchHL+: Batch Dynamic Labelling for Distance Queries on Large-Scale Networks"
  image: VLDBJ2023-Batch+.png
  description: We develop a new batch-dynamic algorithm, called BatchHL+, which can dynamize distance labelling for distance queries much more efficiently than existing work. Theoretically, we provide formal proofs for the correctness and minimality of BatchHL+ through a delicate analysis of patterns of interactions. Empirically, we show that BatchHL+ significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on 15 real-world networks, with up to 3 orders of magnitude faster in reflecting updates of rapidly changing graphs for distance queries.

  image: UAI2023-GM.png
  description: Deep graph matching techniques have shown promising results in recent years. In this work, we cast deep graph matching as a contrastive learning task. Then we explore the power of contrastive loss to effectively incorporate an one-to-one mapping constraint into the learning objective through the choice of negative samples that are most informative and relevant. We propose StableGM, a new deep graph matching architecture based on stable marriage algorithms, which can theoretically guarantee the dual-optimality of matching solutions.

  description: Graph search, a fundamental element of graph theory, plays an important role in solving many problems that cannot be tackled by GNNs. In this work, we investigate the expressivity of graph neural network (GNN) from the perspective of graph search. Two classical graph search methods, breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), are studied in the context of GNNs. We show either method can be used to design a vertex colouring algorithm, called local vertex colouring (LVC), which goes beyond 1-WL.

  description: To reflect rapid changes on graphs when answering shortest-path distance queries, we devise a parallel fully dynamic labelling method, which can leverage two sources of efficiency gains - landmark parallelism and anchor parallelism. Furthermore, this fully dynamic method can handle both incremental and decremental updates efficiently using a unified search approach and a bounded repairing inference mechanism. We empirically verify its efficiency and scalability on 10 real-world large networks.

  description: Is the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy a good yardstick for expressivity of GNNs? In the search for an answer to this question, we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the WL hierarchy is not well-suited for measuring expressive GNNs. Thus, we explore a hierarchy of expressivity that is grounded on a new class of graph isomorphism algorithms, namely Neighbourhood WL algorithms, which exhibit a natural and strict hierarchy of expressivity for measuring GNNs.

In this work, we propose a novel graph restructuring method that can be integrated into any type of GNNs, including classical GNNs, to leverage their nice properties such as efficiency, simplicity, and explainability while alleviating their limitations.

  description: Knowledge Tracing (KT) concerns about how to effectively track the learning progress of a student through their online interaction with learning materials. We present a detailed survey of the KT literature. A broad range of methods starting from early attempts to recent state-of-the-art methods using deep learning have been covered, while we highlight the theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets. We also shed light on key modelling differences between closely related methods, discuss current research gaps in the KT literature, and possible future research directions.

However, challenges still remain, e.g., how to represent forgetting behaviours over time? How to identify relationships among latent concepts from questions? We tackle these challenges by introducing a novel forgetting-robust KT model, Deep Graph Memory Network (DGMN), to dynamically trace a student’s knowledge states over latent concepts.

  description: Very recently, several batch-dynamic algorithms have been reported, mostly focusing on traditional graph problems such as graph connectivity, dynamic trees and k-clique counting. As of yet, batch-dynamic algorithms for shortest-path distance have been left unexplored, depsite that distance querying is a fundmental problem in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a batch-dynamic method, BatchHL, to dynamize distance labellings efficiently in order to reflect large batches of updates on a graph.

  description: Due to the dynamic nature of real-world networks, such as social networks or web graphs in which a link between two entities may fail or become alive at any time, there is a pressing need to address the shortest path distance problem for dynamic networks. In this article, we propose a fully dynamic labelling method to efficiently update distance labelling. At its core, our method incorporates two building blocks for handling incremental update operations and decremental update operations, respectively.

Two strongly convex regularization terms are introduced to improve the learning ability. The framework is robust and can guarantee the numerical stability in optimization.
